# Shopping List Server Project

This project is the server-side implementation for a shopping list application, designed to handle API requests for managing shopping items and historical purchases. It uses Node.js with Express for the server logic, Sequelize as the ORM for database interactions, and provides endpoints for both real-time and historical data management.

## Features

- REST API endpoints to add and fetch products.
- Endpoint to view all historical purchases with detail.
- Data validation and error handling.
- Integration with SQL databases using Sequelize.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express**: Minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **Sequelize**: A promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server.
- **SQLite**: A C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
